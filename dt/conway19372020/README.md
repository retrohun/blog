John Horton Conway passed away last weekend, one of the greatest mathematicians with incredibly many contributions to several areas to my (our?) favourite discipline. Proved that not just the Sun, but the Moon shines for all. Even he was a member of the sporadic Conway group - other notable members are for example Bourne (/bin/sh). His Erd≈ës-number is minimized in his life (1).

## 31 years later

In 1989-04-17, QNX2 demofloppy had been released. It contained a game of life implementation that can play random patterns, but it can play arbitrary files. Without having documentation of "playable" pattern file formats, guessed that a pattern file is composed of space/"o"/QNX-lineends (0x20, 0x6F, 0x1E). Basically it is a plain textfile in QNX environment.

### GIF recording

Configuration parameters: IBM PC 5150 with 10MB installed harddisk, mounted demofloppy image, copied from 1:/cmds/life to 3:/cmds/, fed with a custom fastmade pattern file including Gosper glider gun, pentadecathlon glider shuttle, and other oscillators that can fit into a 80x23 box (non-toroidal). A whole session'd been recorded, download from here:
