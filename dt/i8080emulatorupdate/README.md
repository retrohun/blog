## Minor features

Hardcoded 2k basic rom image is now stored in default external file
called 2kbasic.rom. Loadable rom image file can be set via first
command line argument. Displayed number of loaded bytes are bogus,
because bash does not have builtins to handle CHR$(0) input and EOF.

Download updated emulator script and rom file here:

- [i8080.sh](./i8080.sh)
- [2kbasic.rom](./2kbasic.rom)
