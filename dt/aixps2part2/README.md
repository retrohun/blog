## Bochs installation recording reuploaded
This post is shorter than expected; a continuation of [part one](../aixps2part1).
I was asked in email after removing my stuff from university
servers if the original [AIX PS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX#IBM_PS/2_series) detailed
installation procedure would be available online again.
Despite it is *Hungarian only* and was created around 2010, became
somewhat popular.
So glad to announce that it is online again, converted to github markdown:

- [AIX PS/2 dual boot Bochs VM installation](./aixps2.md)

Original source: [aixps2.html](./aixps2.html)

## Remarks

- The screenshots had been automatically taken by quick and dirty scripts using only some unix shell and basic X11 tools including file deduplication and lossless textmode character recognition including cursor, screenshot-to-html conversion etc.
- Allegedly it is the first detailed **virtual** aixps2 installation howto
- Networking, DOSVM/MERGE etc. installation steps not included, but the guest is prepared
- No markdown version yet
- Hungarian, most installer screens are self-explanatory
