## Processing the queue

A neverending story, as usual, emptying the queue of TODOs, like retroblogging, posting
about new projects etc. It seem to be a so-called white hole, according to some
physicists. Planned a while to fix some bugs in i8080.sh. The motivation was that others
already had done some cool improvements and they demonstrated all in this youtube video:

[Zork, CP/M running on BASH, with /dev/fb0 as memory](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7MO9w6h6Hwo)

Many thanks to CSONCRC, the progress is so inspiring! At least for me, so I updated my bash
code with fixing the waiting-for-the-enter after every printout when running the 2k basic rom.
Still cannot run Zork (in Z-machine in CP/M) - hence the title. Remarkably to my fix, that a
possible caveat is that it might break backward compatibility with some older bash versions
floating around.
